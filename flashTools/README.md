# Flash Tools

Some tools to deal with Flash content.

SWFMake was used to link several SWF together, but also build SWF out of images, sounds, etc.
It contains also an AS1 bytecode obfuscator based on Flash API whitelist keywords.

Obfu9 is a more complex ActionScript3 bytecode obfuscator, we even sold a few licenses at that time, but it required quite technical knowledge to be used correctly.

Since Flash content could be easily decompiled, it was important for us to have a good obfuscator since our web games security depended on it. This allowed us to get "security through obfuscation" for our communication protocols, and also perform a number of memory checks against external changes with cheat engines.

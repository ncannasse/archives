Version 0.02
August 26, 2002

This is a major upgrade, with several new modules and some incompatible
changes from version 0.01.  The differences are too numerous to list in
detail, but the major new features are as follows:

- Window subclassing

  The OCaml programmer can now write custom window procedures and easily pass
  messages from one window procedure to another.  One effect of this change is
  that it's now easy to "subclass" a window -- whether the window is defined in
  OCaml or in C -- to change its behavior.

  The pattern for defining message handlers and registering window classes has
  changed, so old code will need to be updated.  See messages.txt for details.

- Dynamic linking

  OCaml-Win32 can now be built as a DLL to be loaded by OCaml's dynamic linking
  feature.

- Compatibility with OCaml threads

  The library is now compatible with OCaml's threads.

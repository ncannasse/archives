Procedure for adding and compiling extensions :

1) copy extensions files into the /ext directory of the ocaml win32 api source distribution
2) add the following lines to Makefile :

(in macros definitions)

EXTMODULES= (list of modules in the /ext directory)
- don't forget to use the "\" as directory separator for "del" semantic
- eg : EXTMODULES= ext\win32_pack.+ ext\win32_richedit.+ ...

and add $(EXTMODULES) to the MODULES macro
add also EXTFLAGS= -I ext
add the following libs to WINLIBS & CCLIBS : comdlg32.lib + comctl32.lib

(in compilation options)

add $(EXTFLAGS) to the ocamlc & ocamlopt parameters when compiling .ml files


--- add the following at the end of win32.ml -----

(* Nicolas Cannasse EXTENSIONS *)
include Win32_comctrl
include Win32_comdlg
include Win32_richedit
include Win32_shell
include Win32_dynlink

-----------------------------------------------------

(IF you're using OCaml 3.04, you'll get an error "Cannot load module" if you dynamicly link with win32.cma.
To avoid that, recompile win32.cma with "-dllib dllwin32" instead of "-dllib -lwin32" (this is a known bug
in dynlink module under 3.04) - corrected under 3.05)


Now it works :)

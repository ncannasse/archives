<h1>3D and controls</h1>

In this tutorial you will learn basics to import a mesh in Honsen, move the camera and use keyboard.

<h1>HSX file</h1>

As seen in <a href="tutos2.html">previous tutorial</a>, you have to make an hsx file that describes all
the ressources you want to use.<br>
Your mesh is a ressource, so is its texture.</br>
So add red lines to your hsx file:

<pre>
	&lt;honsen width="800" height="600" bgcolor="0xFFFFFF" fps="40"&gt;
	    &lt;mts file="main.mts"/&gt;
	    <font color="red">&lt;pic file="tanookiSkin.jpg"/&gt;
	    &lt;mtw file="tan.mtw"&gt;
	    	&lt;id name="Tan" res="Tan"/&gt;
	    &lt;/mtw&gt;</font>
	&lt;/honsen&gt;
</pre>

<b>File</b> is always the name and path of physical ressource.<br>
<i>mtw</i> tag need a subtag called <i>id</i>. This subtag take a <b>name</b> (the name of the mesh in the mtw file) and a <b>res</b>
(the name of the ressource to use in the program).<br>


<h1>MTS file</h1>

First, create a function called <i>update</i> with no parameters and make it the main loop of the application.<br>
To import a mesh, we will use the <code>Mesh</code> class.Try this code to importe the mesh called <i>Tan</i> in the hasx file:

<mts>
	myMesh = new Mesh('Tan);
</mts>

It's enough to see the mesh in the window ! (even the main loop is not necessary)
<center><img src="tutos/screen3-1.gif" /></center>
As you can see the mesh is very far away and we don't see it very well.<br>
Let's set the camera position and target to have a good view of our mesh !<br>
The camera in Honsen is a global that you can access with <code>_camera</code>.

<table>
<tr>
<td>
To perfectly understand how to place the camera, you should
know the general orientation of an Honsen scene. The picture above illustrate it.
<td><img src="tutos/3Daxes.gif" />
</table>

As a mesh is placed in (0,0,0) by default, we have to put our camera in (0,10,1) to be in front of the mesh, and the camera target
has to be (0,0,1) to look at the mesh (our model is about 2 hight, that's why we put both z to 1). Default light came from negative y,
we choose to set the camera position in (0,-10,1) to have better illumination.
This 2 lines do the job:

<mts>
	camera._pos = new Vector(0,-10,1);
	camera._target = new Vector(0,0,1);
</mts>

Now you can see this.

<center><img src="tutos/screen3-2.gif" /></center>

Our model is well in the range of the camera but not in the good orientation (because we inverse y axis for ligthening).
Just add this line to turn him in the good direction.

<mts>
	myMesh.rot(0, 0, pi);
</mts>

The goal of this operation is to rotate the mesh of pi radians around the z-axis.
Here is the result.

Better no ?
<br>
Another solution could have been letting camera in front of the mesh and mesh in basic orientation. Good illumination could be
obtained by moving the light position in the scene accessing the light global variable in this way for exemple.
<mts>
light._direction = new Vector(0, 1, -2);
</mts>


<h1>Take control</h1>

Now it's time to add some interactions possibility to our example.<br>
Honsen provides a powerfull support for keyboard and mouse events.<br>
Simply declare key listeners in this way.

<mts>
	left = new Key("LEFT");
	right = new Key("RIGHT");
</mts>

and in the main loop you can test the state of your keys.
For example, the <code>is_down()</code> function return <i>true</i> if the key is actually down.
Many others functions can be used to handle keyboard as you can see in the documentation.
Add this lines to your main loop to handle the left and right keys.

<mts>
	if(left.is_down()) {
		rotate_cam(0,0,0.1);
	}
	if(right.is_down()) {
		rotate_cam(0,0,-0.1);
	}
</mts>

The function <code>rotate_cam(x,y,z)</code> is not implemented and you have to do it.
Here is his code.

<mts>
	function rotate_cam(x, y, z) {
		var q = new Quaternion(x, y, z);
		camera._pos *= q.to_matrix();
	}
</mts>

This function will transform the position of the camera by a matrix corresponding to a rotation
of x around x-axis, y around y-axis and z around z-axis.<br>

In fact, in the example, the camera will rotate around the origine z-axis and as its target does not
change, it seems its turns around the mesh (which is in (0,0,0).
<br>
<br>
At the end of the tutorial, your mts file should looks like that:

<mts>
	import Math;

	function rotate_cam(x, y, z) {
		var q = new Quaternion(x, y, z);
		camera._pos *= q.to_matrix();
	}

	function update() {
		if(left.is_down()) {
			rotate_cam(0,0,0.1);
		}
		if(right.is_down()) {
			rotate_cam(0,0,-0.1);
		}
	}

	myMesh = new Mesh('Tan);
	myMesh.rot(0, 0, pi);

	camera._pos = new Vector(0,-10,1);
	camera._target = new Vector(0,0,1);

	left = new Key("LEFT");
	right = new Key("RIGHT");

	set_main(update);
</mts>


<br>
<br>
At this point you have enough knowledge on Honsen to start making your first game using 2D or 3D features and basic keyboard controls.
To have it more realistic, maybe you will need to animate your 3D models.
<br>
Next step, you will learn <a href="tutos4.html">how to animate a mesh and control this animation</a>.

<h1>Fonts and sprites</h1>

Here we will see how to use fonts to diplay text in the main 3D window and extend it to sprites utilisation.

<h1>HSX file :</h1>

First update your hsx file made in <a href="tutos1.html">first tutorial</a> this way:
<pre>
	&lt;honsen width="800" height="600" bgcolor="0xFFFFFF" fps="40"&gt;
	    &lt;mts file="main.mts"/&gt;
	    <font color="red">&lt;font face="Atlantis" size="40" italic="true" file="CW_ATLAN.ttf" res="Atlantis"/&gt;</font>
	&lt;/honsen&gt;
</pre>

A new ressource is necessary to use fonts: the <b>font</b> ressource here in red.
Each kind of ressources has its proper options and you have to set them correclty.
For a font:
<table>
<tr>
	<td>face
	<td>the real name of the font in its file.
<tr>
	<td>size
	<td>size of the font you want to use.
<tr>
	<td>italic
	<td>whether the font will be display in italic or not.
<tr>
	<td>bold
	<td>whether the font will be display in bold or not.
<tr>
	<td>file
	<td>name and path of the file containing the font.
<tr>
	<td>res
	<td>name of the ressource, the name you will use to call this ressource in your code.
</table>


<h1>MTS file</h1>

Printing in the 3D view is a little harder than in the log window. The following code do the job:
<mts>
	myGroup = new Group(0.0002);
	myGroup._x = _width/2;
	myGroup._y = _height/2;

	myText = new Text(myGroup);
	myText._text = "Hello World !!!";
	myText._color = 0x000000;
	myText._font = 'Atlantis;
	myText._x = -100;
	myText._y = -2;
</mts>

Very simply, we first create a group to contain the text.

<mts>
	myGroup = new Group(0.0002);
	myGroup._x = _width/2;
	myGroup._y = _height/2;
</mts>

In Honsen, every 2D ressources (text, sprite..) have to be pack in a group.<br>
A group can translate, rotate or scale and its transformations are also applyed to the ressources it contains.
This way you can transform many objects at the same time if they are in the same group.<br>
In the example, we have translate the group in the middle of the screen ( <code>_width</code> and  <code>_height</code>
are globals set respectively to the width and the height of the window you specify in the hsx file ) modifying its
<code>_x</code> and  <code>_y</code> coordonates.<br>
<br>

Then we create the text we want to display.

<mts>
	myText = new Text(myGroup);
	myText._text = "Hello World !!!";
	myText._color = 0x000000;
	myText._font = 'Atlantis;
	myText._x = -100;
	myText._y = -2;
</mts>

When we create a text we have to specify the group to put it in, here the group we just create before (<i>myGroup</i>).<br>
Then set the text to fit what you need. Many fields are essential such as :

<ul>
<li><code>_text</code> that will contain the real text
<li><code>_font</code> that is the ressource to use as font for this text (ressource name are always preceded by a quote (') )
</ul>

And others are optional :

<ul>
<li><code>_color</code> the color of the text, an <i>int</i> of the form 0xRRGGBB with RR, GG, BB in the range [00, FF]
<li><code>_x</code> the x coordinate of the text in the group coordinates system
<li><code>_y</code> the y coordinate of the text in the group coordinates system
<li><code>_alpha</code> the transparrency of the text in range [0, 1]
<li> ...
</ul>
<br>

Compile using hsmake and you see something like that<br>
<center><img src="tutos/screen2-1.gif" /></center>

<br>
OK it works !<br>
But maybe you are searching for the main loop of the application...in fact there is no !<br>
Now let's have some fun with our text and define a main loop.<br>

<h3>The main loop :</h3>

To have Honsen loop on a function and so create an interactive application, you just have to call the function
<code>set_main(loop_function)</code> with, in parameter, the function you want to use as main loop. <br>
For example, add this line in the end of your mts file:
<mts>
	set_main(update);
</mts>

and at the beggining of the program, define the function <code>update()</code> in this way:

<mts>
	function update() {

	}
</mts>

Now, the function <code>update()</code> will be called by Honsen at the rate you specify in your hsx file.<br>
To illustrate its works, we are going to make the text zoom, spin and change color along the time.<br>
We need two vectors to store the colors we want to interpolate, declare them global, just before our text:
<mts>
	c1 = new Vector(255,0,0);
	c2 = new Vector(0,0,255);
</mts>

Its the only thing we need outside the main loop.<br>
In the function <code>update()</code> we will calculate a coefficient with the <code>cos(x)</code> function and
the <code>time()</code> function. The <code>time()</code> function returns the time in millisecond ellapsed since
the beginning of the application.<br>
We also compute the interpolation between the two vectors using the <code>vlerp(v1, v2, coef)</code> function.
<code>vlerp</code> and <code>cos</code> are part of the math module so we need to import it at the beginning of the file:

<mts>
	import Math;
</mts>

Last step is to set at each turn the new value of <code>_color, _rotation, _xscale, _yscale</code> fields of the group or the text.
<br>
At the end you should have a mts file containing something like that:

<mts>
	import Math;

	function update() {
		ct = cos(time());
		c = vlerp(c1, c2, (ct+1)/2);

		myText._color = int(c._x)*65536 + int(c._y)*256 + int(c._z);
		myGroup._rotation += 0.1;
		myGroup._xscale = ct + 2;
		myGroup._yscale = ct + 2;
	}

	c1 = new Vector(255,0,0);
	c2 = new Vector(0,0,255);

	myGroup = new Group(0.0002);
	myGroup._x = _width/2;
	myGroup._y = _height/2;

	myText = new Text(myGroup);
	myText._text = "Hello World !!!";
	myText._color = 0x000000;
	myText._font = 'Atlantis;
	myText._x = -100;
	myText._y = -2;

	set_main(update);
</mts>

If you compile and run this you will see your text zooming, spinning and progressively go from red to blue !

<h3>Using Sprites :</h3>

We are going to add spinning circles on the screen using the sprite api.
First we have to add the ressource we want to use as sprite in the hsx file.

<pre>
	&lt;honsen width="800" height="600" bgcolor="0xFFFFFF" fps="40"&gt;
	    &lt;mts file="main.mts"/&gt;
	    &lt;font face="Atlantis" size="40" italic="true" file="CW_ATLAN.ttf" res="Atlantis"/&gt;
	    <font color="red">&lt;pic file="particule.png" res="Particule"/&gt;</font>
	&lt;/honsen&gt;
</pre>

The <i>res</i> field is also used to reference the ressource from the script.
<br>
Two little functions to manage our sprites along the time:
<mts>
function update_sprite(s, p) {
	var a = s.ang + s.aspeed;
	var d = s.dist;
	s.ang = a;
	s._x = Math.cos(a)*d;
	s._y = Math.sin(a)*d;
}

function gen_sprite() {
	var s = new Sprite(spriteGroup);
	s.ang = random(360)*Math.pi/180;
	s.dist = random(_width)/2;
	s.aspeed = random(10)/100.0;
	s._width = 10;
	s._height = 10;
	s._color = random(0xFFFFFF);
	s._bitmap = 'Particule;
	s._alpha = 0.2;
	sprites.add(s);
}
</mts>

First one is only math stuff to compute the next position of a sprite. <br>
Second is more interessant. <code>gen_sprite</code> generate a sprite, computing and giving him a variation
angle and a distance to the group.
It also fill important fields of sprite class like width and height, color or alpha. Finaly it sets the bitmap
field with the ressource we choose: Particule.<br>
<br>
As <code>Text</code>, a <code>Sprite</code> need a <code>Group</code> to be created in.<br>
<br>
Other useful parametters you can modify are:
<ol>
<li>depth: the drawing priority order of the sprite</li>
<li>tu, tv, tu2, tv2: uv coordinates in the ressource used to choose drawing only a particular region of the
picture used as ressource</li>
</ol>

uv coordinates are proportions of the global size.Set to (0, 0) (1, 1), it represents the full picture.
Set to (0.5, 0) (1, 0.5), it represents the right upper quarter of the picture.<br>
<br>
Just add those lines to your code to have some sprite spinning on the screen.
<mts>
	spriteGroup = new Group(0.0002);
	spriteGroup._x = _width/2;
	spriteGroup._y = _height/2;

	sprites = new List();
	for(i=0;i<100;i++)
		gen_sprite();
</mts>

And this line in your update function
<mts>
	sprites.iter(update_sprite, null);
</mts>

<br>
<br>
You are now familiar with 2D features of Honsen and ready to pass to 3D.

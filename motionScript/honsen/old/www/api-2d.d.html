<h1>2D library :</h1>

2D bitmap rendering : to display 2D sprites, two classes are available : Sprite and Group. Sprite allow you to draw a bitmap at a precise point
and to change its size, color and position. Group allow to gather many Sprites, draw them in a "depth" determined order and make them rotate,
resize or other transformations.
<br>
<br>
<i>This library is part of Standard (Std) library, so it is automatically included in all MTS files.</i>

<h3>Group :</h3>

Two groups types are present : principal groups and sub-groups. A prncipal group is created with a specified <i>z</i> value
(between 0 and 1). It will allow to display a group of Sprites each with the same <i>z</i> value in order to intercalate many Sprites planes
with 3D objects (this ones are drawn behind or in front of Sprites planes depending of their <i>z</i>) value.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, a sub-group simply allow to gather Sprites to transform them simultaneously. A sub-group must belong to a principal group
or another sub-group.<br>
<br>
In a same group, Sprites and sub-groups are sorted by "depht" (drawing priority), those with tallest depth being first drawn.
Many Sprites and sub-groups can have the same depth, in this case drawing priority is given to the last added.

<table>
<tr>
	<td class="prem">new Group(z)
	<td>create a new principal group with z value.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">new Group(g)
	<td>create a new sub-group and add it to g.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_x
	<td>read or write x group postition.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_y
	<td>read or write y group postition.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_visible
	<td>allow to know if the group is visible and to change its visibility.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_depth
	<td>read or write group drawing priority.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_color
	<td>read or write group color mask.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_alpha
	<td>read or write group transparency coeficient (between 0 and 1).
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_parent
	<td>(read only) : return the sub-group parent group or <code>null</code> if it is a principal group.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">remove()
	<td>destroy the group, all its sub-groups and sprites added to.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_xscale
	<td>read or write horizontal scale factor.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_yscale
	<td>read or write vertical scale factor.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_rotation
	<td>read or write group rotation angle (radian) : all sub-elements of the group will do a rotation
		refering to group (0,0) point.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_z
	<td>read or write <i>z</i> value of a principal group.
</table>

<h3>Sprite :</h3>

A Sprite allow to draw a bitmap picture at a given site.

<table>
<tr>
	<td class="prem">new Sprite(g)
	<td>create a new sprite and add it to g group.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_x
	<td>read or write x sprite coordinate.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_y
	<td>read or write y sprite coordinate.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_visible
	<td>allow to know if the sprite is visible and to change its visibility.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_depth
	<td>read or write sprite drawing priority.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_color
	<td>read or write sprite color mask.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_alpha
	<td>read or write sprite transparency coeficient (between 0 and 1).
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_parent
	<td>(read only) : return sprite parent group.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">remove()
	<td>destroy the sprite.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_width
	<td>read or write horizontal sprite size.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_height
	<td>read or write vertical sprite size.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_tu _tv _tu2 _tv2
	<td>read or write sprite textures coordinate (see below).
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_bitmap
	<td>read or write sprite picture used. (null or PIC resource type)
</table>
<br>
Picture displayed by the sprite correspond to a part of its _bitmap picture. To select this part, we use textures coordinates
(tu,tv) and (tu2,tv2), between 0 and 1. So (0,0)-(1,1) correspond to the full picture and (0.5,0)-(1,0.5) correspond to the upper right
picture quarter.

<h3>Text :</h3>

A text is displayed as a sprite, it must be included in a group.

<table>
<tr>
	<td class="prem">new Text(g)
	<td>create a new text and add it to g group.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_x
	<td>read or write x text coordinate.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_y
	<td>read or write y text coordinate.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_visible
	<td>allow to know if the text is visible and to change its visibility.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_depth
	<td>read or write text drawing priority.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_color
	<td>read or write text color mask.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_alpha
	<td>read or write text transparency coeficient (between 0 and 1).
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_parent
	<td>(read only) : return text parent group.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">remove()
	<td>destroy the text.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_text
	<td>read or write displayed string.
<tr>
	<td class="prem">_font
	<td>read or modify font used to display text. null value make the text invisible. Default font is null.
</tr>

		Motion-Twin is a young and bright team of graphics designers and skilled programmers that
		are enjoying making games for a living. In order to push further the possibilities of web-based
		games, we have created Honsen and we hope it will be adopted by the community as a de-facto
		standard for creating 3D web contents.

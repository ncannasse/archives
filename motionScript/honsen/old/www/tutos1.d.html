<h1>Hello World : first Honsen application</h1>

This document will teach you how to create your first Honsen application (typical "Hello World")
very easily.

<h1>HSX file</h1>

First of all, you will need to create a library file (.hsx) to set basic options of your application
and indicate which ressources to use.
<pre>
	&lt;honsen width="800" height="600" bgcolor="0xFFFFFF" fps="40"&gt;
	    &lt;mts file="main.mts"/&gt;
	&lt;/honsen&gt;
</pre>

Only one ressource is needed for this example:
<ol>
	<li><code>&lt;mts file="main.mts"/&gt;</code> gives the path and name of the only file we are using (main.mts)
</ol>

Options sets in <code>&lt;honsen /&gt;</code> are generals options of the application.<br>
Here we ask Honsen to run the main loop at 40 frames per second in a window of 800 pixels
large and 600 pixels hight on a white baground.

<h1>MTS file</h1>

An mts file is a code file and so the main file of your aplication. <br>
You can have unlimited number of mts files to describe your application but in this example we will only have one (main.mts as we specified in the hsx file). <br>
Here comes the code you need to display "Hello World !!!" in a log window.
<mts>
	print("Hello World");
</mts>

At this point you have a runnable Honsen application. Just compile your hsx file using hsmake tool and then run the hs file just
created by the compilation using hsrun tool.

You should have something like that on your screen<br>

<br>
You just have made your first Honsen application and now you have understood the way it works. You can start writting your own
application but maybe you first want to learn more on other interesting features explained in next tutorials.

This contains some old sources of mine, that have been important at some point in the development of the games and technologies I wrote. 

They are of course no longer maintained and have very little pratical usage, apart historical studies of code evolution, and a bit of nostalgia too.

Each directory project is documented with notes (README.md), so feel free to explore.
